## 📈 Fine-tuning Process

### Why Fine-tuning?
The pre-trained model was trained on general fake news, but e-commerce reviews have different characteristics. Fine-tuning adapts the model to your specific domain.

### Process
1. **Data Preparation**: Load labeled dataset (OR=Real, CG=Fake)
2. **Training**: Update model parameters on your data
3. **Evaluation**: Test on holdout set
4. **Deployment**: Automatically use improved model

### Dataset Format
```csv
text,label
"This product is great!",OR
"This is a fake review",CG
```

## 🧪 Validation and Testing

### Validation Features
- **Confusion Matrix**: True/false positives and negatives
- **Sample Predictions**: Examples of correct/incorrect classifications
- **Confidence Analysis**: Model confidence scores
- **Detailed Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- **Label Distribution**: Analysis of dataset balance

### Testing Workflow
1. Split dataset into training/validation sets
2. Train model on training data
3. Evaluate on validation data
4. Show comprehensive results with debugging info

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Out of Memory**: Reduce batch size in fine-tuning
2. **Slow Performance**: Use smaller model or fewer epochs
3. **Poor Accuracy**: Check dataset quality and labels
4. **Model Not Loading**: Ensure fine-tuned model exists
5. **404 Errors**: Restart backend after changes

### Performance Tips
- Use GPU for faster fine-tuning
- Balance your dataset (similar real/fake counts)
- Clean your data (remove very short/long reviews)
- Use consistent labeling (OR vs CG)
- Test with smaller ranges first
